PHP

some url's specify programs the server should run:
https://webster.cs.washington.edu/cse190m/quote.php

PHP code can be embedded in XHTML code

example php block:

<?php
print"hello!"
?>


variables begin wint $ in php

expession block, prints contents:

<= "Hello"; ?>


string concatenation operator is "." not "+'

this works >> print "you are $age years old.";

append to an array with

$name[] = "Thing_To_Append";

arrays push/pop rear

shifting deals with front

array slices return a subset of array based on passed in indexes

explode/implode convert between strings and arrays.
^can also do this with regex

$_REQUEST << builtin global array that holds http request params. defaults to string type.
