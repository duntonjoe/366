Subqueries - a query nested within another




	Stock			     Nation
	*stkcode\		     *natcode
	STKFIRM	---------------------NATNAME
	NATCODE	/		     EXCHRATE



select stkfirm FROM stock where natcode in (select natcode from nation where natname = 'Australia');

	^report names of all australian stocks.


don't hardcode country code, could change.

Correlated subqueries: solvesthe inner query many times. (outer/inner loop type thing)
	^Can be resource intensive.


Report the country firm & stk holding for the max quantity of stk held for each country:

SELECT natname, stkfirm, 
	(stkqty * stkprice) as holding 
	from stock, nation WHERE nation.natcode = stock.natcode
	AND stkqty = 
	(SELECT MAX(stkqty) FROM stock 
	WHERE stock.natcode = nation.natcode);

Views - virtual tables
	Imaginary table constructed by the DBMS when required.
	Only definition of the ciew is stored,not the result.
	^-Example in SLIDES

Views are used just like tables.
