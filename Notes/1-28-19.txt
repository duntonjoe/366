-primary keys must be unique to each entity.

use "in" keyword when searching for x or y or z

	....WHERE shrcode IN ('x', 'y', 'z');

^other tips in slides.

ORDER BY <- sort rows of table in some way.


Calculate total divedents earned by each stock, report this as payment sort highest-lowest payment:

	select shrfirm, shrqty*shrdiv as payment, from share order by payment desc;

Built-in aggregating functions -> SEE SLIDES

count(*) <- counts rows in the table.

Subqueries:

-All firms with a PE grater than average

	select shrfirm,shrpe form share where shrpe > (select AVG(shrpe) from share);

^simply adding the average column to select would not examine relationshipe between share PE and average.

***USE REGEX INSTEAD OF LIKE KEYWORD***

DISTINCT <- eliminaes duplicate rows.

	SELECT DISTINCT shrpe FROM share;

wrap distinct in a count to save # of unique rows.

verify #7 on lab.
