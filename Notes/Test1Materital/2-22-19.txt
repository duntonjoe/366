Modality - item required vs optional

Assocative relationships depend on 2 different entities

UML Aggregation - usually captured by a 1:m relationship

Habits of effective data modelers:
	immerse
	challenge
	generalize
	test
	limit
	integrate
	complete

Nomralization & other dat modeling methods

Nomalization  - application of a series of rules to gradually improve design

Multidetermination - Agiven value determines multiple values

	attribute realtionships:

	1:1 - A determines B, B determines A.

	1:m - one attribute values determnes another nut not vice versa
	
	m:m - neither attribute determines the other.

Normal forms:

	First Normal form (1NF)
		All rows have same # of columns, single valued attributes only

	2nd Normal Form (2NF)
		violated when a nonkey column isa fact about part of the primary key.
		Column is not fully funtionally dependent on the primary key

	3rd Normal Form (3NF)
		Violated when a nonkey column is a fact about another nonkey column
		A column is not fully funtionally dependent onthe primary key

	4th Normal Form (4NF)
		A row should not contain 2 or more multivalued independant facts
		

	5th Normal Form (5NF)
		A table can be recostructed from other tables
		There exists some rule that enables a realtion to be inferred
